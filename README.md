## Overview
The Conference Ticket Generator is a web application that allows users to generate personalized conference tickets by filling out a form with their details. The application ensures accessibility, state persistence, and responsive design, offering a seamless user experience.

## Core Features
### Form Elements
- **Full Name:** Text input for the user's full name.
- **Email Address:** Email input field.
- **Avatar Upload:** Users should upload their avatar image and store it using Cloudinary or any image hosting service. The form should only accept and submit the image URL.
- **Submit Button:** Button to submit the form.

### Form Validation
- Ensure all required fields are filled in before submission.
- The email should have a valid format.
- The avatar upload should accept Cloudinary URLs or any image link.
- Provide clear error messages near the respective field if validation fails.

### State Persistence
- The form should retain user inputs using IndexedDB or local storage so that the data is not lost on page refresh.

### Accessibility
- Ensure all form fields, hints, and error messages are screen-reader accessible.
- All elements must be focusable, with clear hover and focus states.
- Users must be able to navigate the form and submit it using only the keyboard.

### Ticket Generation
- On successful submission, generate and display a Conference Ticket containing:
  - Full Name
  - Email Address
  - Avatar (displayed as an image from the provided URL)
- The ticket should only be generated if the form passes validation.

### Responsive Design
- Ensure the form and ticket layout adjust seamlessly across different screen sizes.
- Optimize for small screens with proper spacing and stacking.

## Acceptance Criteria
### Form Validation
- Users must provide all required details before submission.
- The email should be in a valid format.
- Avatar uploads should be handled via Cloudinary or any external image URL submission.
- Display relevant error messages near the respective fields.

### State Persistence
- The form fields should persist user input using IndexedDB or local storage, ensuring data remains intact even if the page is refreshed.

### Ticket Generation
- The generated ticket should display the user’s full name, email, and avatar.
- The ticket should only appear when all form validations pass successfully.

### Accessibility
- All form elements and error messages must be fully accessible and announced by screen readers.
- The application must support complete keyboard navigation.

### Responsive Design
- The form and generated ticket must be fully responsive and visually optimized for all device sizes.
- Ensure the ticket is clearly visible immediately after submission on both mobile and desktop screens.

### Code Quality
- Write modular, well-structured, and readable code.
- Utilize appropriate React hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`) for state management and validation.
- Implement proper form element types and validation techniques.
